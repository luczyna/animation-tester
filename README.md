#Animation Tester

This is a simple frame tester for animating something frame by frame. You can load a collection of separate image files to the tester, and see how your animation looks before finallizing any gifs or sprites. You can do the following things:

* set the animation to repeat (or loop)
* set the framerate
* re-upload your images
* pause and play

You can copy this collection of files to your local machine and use **index.html** to start testing. To go through the guts of the tester, you can look through the other files, which were simply minified into index.html.

Enjoy and keep animating.
